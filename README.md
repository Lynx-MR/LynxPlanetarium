# Planetarium 

The solar system at your fingertips. Take the sun outside of the VR orb to experience true AR. This app is designed to showcase the capabilities of mixed reality with a solar system. In addition, the app shows you how to use primary hand gestures while having fun by grabbing planets and having the possibility even to throw them.
